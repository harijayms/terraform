# Create 2 new Windows VMs, create a new AD Forest, Domain and 2 DCs in an availability set

This template will deploy 2 new VMs (along with a new VNet, Storage Account and Load Balancer) and create a new AD forest and domain. Each VM will be created as a DC for the new domain and will be placed in an availability set. Each VM will also have an RDP endpoint added with a public load balanced IP address.
